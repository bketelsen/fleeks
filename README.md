# Fleek Configuration 

This is the repository for my [fleek](https://github.com/ublue-os/fleek) configuration.

It is mostly basic, stock fleek/nix, with no extra magic added. It shows what a repository
looks like when there are multiple hosts of varying architectures too.

Feel free to fork this and use it for your own fleek starter, although that's really overkill.
It'd be simpler to copy the contents of the `.fleek.yml` file in this repository, DELETE all the
systems under the `systems: ` YAML key, and run `fleek apply`.
